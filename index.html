            Hello, my name is Timothy Robinson. As a soon-to-be graduate of UNC
            Chapel-Hill, I am proud to be a Front End Developer. Over the past
            year, I have worked extensively on developing my front-end skills
            and have become proficient in HTML, CSS including libraries like
            Bootstrap, and Javascript. I have a variety of degrees including a
            Bachelors in Communication Studies and a Masters in Accounting. My
            passion for coding began in high school, where for my senior project
            I developed a web application to display information about various
            types of sharks. Although I thoroughly enjoyed that work, life
            pulled me in a slightly different direction and thus I became an
            Accountant. Quickly after beginning my career as an Accountant, I
            realized that something was missing. The PASSION. The spark and
            enthusiasm that I had when I did my first piece of coding was gone.
            After spending some time as an Accountant, I decided that it was
            time to get back the spark that I felt when I did my first piece of
            coding. Thus I went back to school at UNC Chapel Hill. Armed with
            all of my skills and knowledge, I am ecstatic to finally begin my
            career as a Front End Developer!

            Check-mate is a full-stack web application for keeping track of your
            expenses and setting smart savings goals. The application uses
            node.js, express.js, mySQL, and Sequelize to keep track of users,
            their transactions, and their budget goals on the back end and
            Chart.js, Bootstrap, and Handlebars to visualize every users
            personal information.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Instructions:</b> Users must register to use the program by
            selecting 'Register Here' on the login page. After registering,
            users can login in a view their budget and transaction data. Budgets
            can be set on the left via 'Edit Budget'; income and expenses can be
            added similarly via 'Add Income or Expense'. Adding budgets and
            expenses will update the cards in the center of the application: the
            donut chart will reflect the amount spent in various categories, the
            line chart will show how much was spent each day, and the monthly
            expenses table will show details on that months expenses. Details
            about all transactions and budget info can be seen by selecting
            'Budget Page' and 'Transaction Page' on the left.

            IP Address Tracker is a Front-End application to display location
            when searching an ip address. The application utilizes the IP
            Geolocation API by IPify as well as the LeafletJS mapping API to
            provide the user with not only the city and state, but also a map of
            the grographical area.

            <br />
            <b>Instructions:</b> Users must enter a valid IP Address into the
            search bar. After searching for a valid IP Address, the IP Address,
            Location, Timezone, and ISP information will be populated along with
            the gropgraphical map.

          Coder Finance was my first project working with a team. Due to the
          time crunch and challenges that arose when learning to work in a team
          environment for the first time, we opted to go for a very simplistic
          UI and focus primarily on the functionality. There is a lot that we
          were not able to do with this project, but there was a lot that was
          learned at the same time. Through this project, I got a much better
          understanding of the functionality of Bootstrap and Bootstrap Cards.
          For future development, I would want to do a re-design of the
          application to make it mobile responsive.

          This app is a simple interface that combines a traditional stock
          dashboard with cryptocurrency data, displaying both in a similar time
          frame. When a stock or cypto symbol is entered in to their respective
          search box, a graph be will created showing the 100 day perfromance of
          that asset. The intent is for a user to view the two financial assets
          in a comparable way, letting them see a quick snapshot for the crypto
          and stock of their choice in a way that shows them as equals. Data for
          stock is pulled from the AlphaVantage API and crypto data is pulled
          form Polygon.io API
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Instructions:</b> Users input a valid Stock or Crypto into their
          corresponding search fields. The application will then display current
          data for the searched stock. If an incorrect stock or crypto is
          searched, an error will pop up prompting the user to input a valid
          stock or crypto.

          The Weather Dashboard is one of my early applications that allows
          users to search a city and view the current weather information as
          well as a 5 day forecast utilizing the open weather api. Through this
          project, I learned how to make api calls, how to parse the data, and
          how to display the information from the api calls.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Instructions:</b> Users must enter a valid city into the search
          bar. After searching for a valid city, the corresponding weather
          information will then populate.
